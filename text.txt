problems

after verification the new acc and after hard refresh the user is signed out
after signing in the getProfile useEffect ist responding after hard refresh
example, commenting out the useEffect function, still able to log in, and after refresh logged out
should not be able to log in without the get profile function
redux is working perfectly fine
maybe routing issue?
prefixed with window.location.reload()


props types
select bar type onChange any
index request any
textfield onChange any
3x any
